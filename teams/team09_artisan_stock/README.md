## The Core Problem & Solution

### The Business Challenge
Independent artisans, jewelry designers, leather crafters, candle makers, and apothecary creators often operate with high-value, bespoke raw materials that have long, unpredictable supplier fulfillment lead times (often 7 to 15+ days). Most makers manage inventory informally through memory, manual notebooks, or basic spreadsheets.

Consequently, artisans frequently discover stockouts too late - often right before high-stakes holiday markets, pop-up craft fairs, or retail surges. Running out of a single vital ingredient (e.g., soy wax flakes, earring hooks, or veg-tan leather) stalls the entire studio production cycle, leading to lost revenue and missed market deadlines.

### The Engineering Solution
**The Artisan Safety-Stock Planner** bridges this operational gap by transforming raw material tracking into an autonomous, proactive decision-support engine:
1. **Visual Material Runway Kanban**: Continuously computes inventory runway days ($R = \frac{I_{current}}{d}$) against supplier delivery lead times ($L$).
2. **Three-Tier Urgency Classification**:
   - **[CRITICAL]**: Runway Days $\le$ Lead Time Days (Immediate stockout risk before shipment can physically arrive).
   - **[WARNING]**: Current Stock $\le$ Reorder Point ($ROP$) (Approaching safety buffer threshold).
   - **[HEALTHY]**: Current Stock $> ROP$ (Adequate operational buffer).
3. **Interactive Demand Surge Simulator**: Models festival and seasonal market spikes (1.0x to 3.0x daily consumption rate) to stress-test studio resilience.
4. **What-If Scenario Lab**: Allows makers to adjust lead times, burn rates, and buffer levels interactively to anticipate supply chain shocks.
5. **1-Click Autonomous Purchase Order Studio**: Consolidates endangered materials into standardized, itemized vendor purchase orders with instant plain text (`.txt`) and tabular (`.csv`) export in INR.

## Target Customer Personas

| Persona | Operational Context | Core Value Proposition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Independent Boutique Artisan** | Handcrafts small-batch apparel, leather goods, or ceramics with single-vendor raw materials. | Never gets blindsided by a 14-day vendor lead time before an exhibition. |
| **Apothecary & Candle Maker** | Formulates seasonal fragrances, soy candles, and skincare with perishable or delicate inputs. | Balances holding costs against stockout risks with safety buffer calculations. |
| **Jewelry & Metalcraft Designer** | Utilizes precious metals, hooks, and gemstones with variable daily consumption rates. | Visualizes replenishment capital requirements and exports automated vendor POs. |
| **Small-Batch Studio Director** | Coordinates production across multiple craft lines (textiles, packaging, leather). | Executive dashboard tracking total inventory valuation, high-risk SKUs, and portfolio health. |

## Mathematical & Algorithmic Framework

### 1. Reorder Point ($ROP$) Formula
The Reorder Point determines the precise inventory threshold at which a new supplier order must be placed to avoid exhausting stock during delivery:

$$ROP = (L \times d) + SS$$

Where:
- $L$ = Supplier Fulfillment Lead Time (in days)
- $d$ = Daily Material Burn Rate (units consumed per production day)
- $SS$ = Safety Stock buffer units (protecting against demand variability or shipping delays)

### 2. Inventory Runway Days
Calculates how many days of continuous workshop operations remain before complete material stockout:

$$\text{Runway Days} = \begin{cases} \frac{I_{current}}{d}, & \text{if } d > 0 \\ 999.0, & \text{if } d \le 0 \end{cases}$$

### 3. Three-Tier Health Threshold Logic
$$\text{Status} = \begin{cases} \text{CRITICAL}, & \text{if } \text{Runway Days} \le L \\ \text{WARNING}, & \text{if } I_{current} \le ROP \text{ and Runway Days} > L \\ \text{HEALTHY}, & \text{if } I_{current} > ROP \end{cases}$$

### 4. Stockout Risk Index Score (0.0% to 100.0%)
Quantifies the operational vulnerability of each raw material based on lead time proximity and safety buffer depth.

### 5. Event Demand Surge Modeling
When upcoming pop-ups or holiday craft markets approach, the baseline daily burn rate $d_{base}$ is scaled by a surge factor $M_{surge} \in [1.0, 3.0]$:

$$d_{surge} = d_{base} \times M_{surge}$$

Recalculating both $ROP_{surge}$ and $\text{Runway}_{surge}$ instantly across all tracked materials.

## Vibe-Coding Prompt Log & Execution Strategy

Our development workflow followed a disciplined 3-layer vibe-coding methodology (Math Engine $\rightarrow$ Automated Unit Testing $\rightarrow$ High-Impact Interactive UI):

### Prompt 1: Mathematical Foundation & Core Engine Design
> *"Implement a robust Python module `stock_engine.py` for Team 9: The Artisan Safety-Stock Planner. Define `calculate_safety_stock(lead_time_days, daily_burn_rate, safety_stock_units)` using the standard formula ROP = (L * d) + SS. Define `calculate_runway_days(current_level, daily_burn_rate)`. Implement `evaluate_material_status(row)` to classify items into CRITICAL (Runway <= Lead Time), WARNING (Current <= ROP), and HEALTHY. Include unit costs, replenishment capital for a 30-day runway, and supplier details."*

### Prompt 2: Comprehensive Pytest Verification & Edge Cases
> *"Write a complete automated test suite `tests/test_team09.py` verifying all core functions. Include assertions for schema conformance of `artisan_materials.csv`, mathematical accuracy of ROP, edge-case handling for zero burn rates, status classification thresholds, demand surge multipliers, portfolio summaries, and purchase order text formatting. Ensure 100% test pass rate with pytest."*

### Prompt 3: Production Streamlit Dashboard with Glassmorphism UI
> *"Build an executive Streamlit dashboard in `app.py` that stands out from typical student projects. Add custom CSS with clean cards, glowing status borders, and modern metric tiles. Implement a 3-column Kanban card grid featuring `st.progress` runway health indicators, category pills, and upcoming event triggers. Ensure all autograder widgets (`st.progress`, `st.button`, `st.columns`, `st.download_button`) and user guidance structures are included."*

### Prompt 4: Advanced Supply Chain Diagnostics with Plotly
> *"Add interactive Plotly charts to `app.py`: 1) A Horizon comparison chart displaying Runway Days vs Supplier Lead Time (with a dashed danger threshold line indicating stockout before delivery), 2) A Category Capital Allocation Donut chart showing replenishment budget breakdown, and 3) A Stockout Vulnerability bubble scatter chart mapping burn rate vs stock level with bubble size mapped to supplier lead time."*

### Prompt 5: Event Demand Surge Simulator & What-If Scenario Lab
> *"Add an interactive sidebar slider allowing the artisan to simulate upcoming festival/holiday demand surges (1.0x to 3.0x normal burn rate) that dynamically updates all runway calculations in real time. Create a dedicated 'What-If Scenario Lab' tab where makers can select any material, tweak lead times, burn rates, and safety buffers, and observe instant recalculation of ROP and stockout risks."*

### Prompt 6: Autonomous Purchase Order Studio with Dual Export
> *"Enhance the purchase order generator to produce both an itemized, formal plaintext transmission preview and a structured DataFrame. Add dual download buttons using `st.download_button` allowing users to download the purchase order as a clean `.txt` file or as an Excel-ready `.csv` file with automatic grand total computation."*
